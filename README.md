# HackCupertino
Welcome! Diarrix is a crowdsourced crime-tracking app that allows anyone to report and see the crime that's going on in their area! Using the Firebase API, CoreLocation, and MapKit, anyone can see where the crimes are and receive descriptions about what's happening (even adding your own if you see something new)
